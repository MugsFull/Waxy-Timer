# Waxy Timer

**Waxy Timer** is a lightweight Windows utility that tracks mouse clicks and keystrokes in a specific target window (such as *2004Scape Game* or a browser window) and automatically resets a configurable countdown timer when activity is detected.

It is intentionally simple and styled like something that was made in 2004.

Waxy Timer is an **unsigned open-source application**.

This is expected behavior for indie Windows utilities distributed outside the Microsoft Store.
