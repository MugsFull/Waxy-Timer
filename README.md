# Waxy Timer

Waxy Timer is a lightweight Windows utility that tracks user activity in a specific
target window (such as 2004Scape Game or a browser window) and automatically resets
a configurable countdown timer when activity is detected.

It is designed to be simple and look like it was made in 2004.

## Download (Windows)

👉 **https://github.com/MugsFull/Waxy-Timer/releases/latest**

### ⚠️ Important
- Download **`WaxyTimer-Windows.zip`** from the **Assets** section  
- Do **NOT** download **“Source code (zip)”** — that is not the application

---

## How to Run

1. Download **`WaxyTimer-Windows.zip`**
2. Right-click the file → **Extract**
3. Open the extracted **`Waxy Timer`** folder
4. Run **`Waxy Timer.exe` from inside that folder**

⚠️ **Do not move the EXE out of the folder.**  
The EXE must remain next to the `internal` folder to work correctly.

## Windows SmartScreen Notice

This is expected for unsigned open-source Windows applications.

## Troubleshooting

### “Failed to start embedded python interpreter”
This usually means the EXE was moved out of its folder or the ZIP was not extracted
correctly.

Make sure:
- `Waxy Timer.exe` is in the same folder as the `internal` directory
- You are running the EXE **from inside the extracted folder**
